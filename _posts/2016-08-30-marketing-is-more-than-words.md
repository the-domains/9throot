When we build a marekting campaign we have to be mindful of both the audience as well as the organization we're representing. We can't build a campaign strictly out of what the consumer wants...or can we?  Marketing campaigns are about content. Content is consumed in numerous ways, from phones, tablets, desktops, the user might see this content on the main website, the blog, a re-tweet, a facebook meme, a instagram photo, and so many others.
